## Fund releasing Plan
In this section we want to understand what's the reasoning behind the amount that you are proposing. This can match the milestones that are in the execution Plan.

For each milestone you must resend the proposal, and it will be voted by the token holders. You can decide if you want to do 1 big milestone, or split in several milestones in order to be validated and get paid earlier.

Remember to add workforce, aproximately salaries, and costs (servers, domains, etc.).

For example, if you ask for 500,000 BOS for a project scoped in 6 months, you can split it in several milestones where you get audited, paid and you need to get voted by token holders, or you can do 1 big milestone of 6 months, where you will be audited and paid at the end of the project.
